# Parallel-Computing

This is a repo to store the code of my parallel-computing projects, I will keep updating if I have more parallel computing projects.

1. Matrix Multiplication :
This is a school project I made when I was a junior in univeristy, and it increases the running time of matrix multiplication of two large matrice.
