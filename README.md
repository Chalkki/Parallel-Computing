# Parallel-Computing

This is a repo to store the code of my parallel-computing projects, I will keep updating if I have more parallel computing projects.

1. Matrix Multiplication :
This is a school project I made when I was a junior in univeristy, and it increases the running time of matrix multiplication of two large matrice.
Due to the restriction of file uploading, the test case is too large to be uploaded on Github. If you are interested in testing the code, here is the link for the input :https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TBPuN3e9oNhL3ajlVTWZPGJV0RqrIoxk/view?usp=sharing . (Make sure the OpenMP is on when you test the code)
